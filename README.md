# csharp-calculator
Application used on C# learning purposes

##Task 1

Imagine simplistic caclulator application which contains next UI elements:
* Read-only text box to show current entry or results of calculation.
* 10 buttons to enter numbers from 0 to 9.
* 4 buttons related with basic arithmetic operations ("/", "*", "-", "+').
* Button to calculate result ("=").
* Button to clean text box with results ("C").

For the sake of simplicity we will not deal currently with:
* Negative numbers.
* Numbers with fractional part.

Your first goal will be to propose API which can handle clicks on all buttons above. 
Do not think about UI, do not think about C#, concentrate on trying to understand what happens under the hood, which data types are processed and what is the most convenient way to make it work.
I expect to obtain from you list which includes:
* Name of method or methods you want to add.
* List of parameters for each method (if any) including their names and data types (do not bother with C#, just use common sense).
* Type of return value for each method ("no return value" answer is valid).
* Short textual description of each method (what is it's intent).

Please do not google answer, the key of this task is to start discussion about optimal solution and evolve it together. Thank you.
